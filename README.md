# COVID-19 Data Analysis
A project based on COVID-19 Data gathered from South Korea. The project proposal is by Turing College.


The HTML file provides the EDA of COVID-19 Pandemic Situation in South Korea.

In this analysis I used Geopandas for visualisations of worldmap. The documentation you can find [here](https://geopandas.org/en/stable/docs.html).

K-Means Clustering was an additional challenge for this first EDA Turing College project.
